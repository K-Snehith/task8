# 🎯 Task 8: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score using the **Mall Customers** dataset. The clustering results help businesses understand different customer groups for targeted marketing.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `task8.py` — Python script for clustering and visualization
- `Mall_Customers.csv` — Dataset containing customer information
- `cleaned_clusters.csv` — (optional) clustered output if saved
- Plot screenshots — (optional) elbow and cluster plots

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Load and explore the Mall Customers dataset
- Apply the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Implement **K-Means Clustering** using Scikit-learn
- Visualize customer segments
- Evaluate clustering performance using **Silhouette Score**
